Assumptions

- There is no maximum number of possilbe allowable spiders, this is more than the minimum of 4
- It is able to walk through anything but boulders and other moving entities (except character)
- Assume that the spider spawns every 10 ticks
- If a spider was to spawn on top of the boulder, it will just go in the reverse direction

saveGame

- The user will get access to all the saves, so they can have access to previous saves which wont be overriden.

Zombie Toast Spawner

- A user cannot walk on top of the zombie toast spawner because that is where the zombies are being spawned

Zombie

Bribed mercenary

- A bribed mercenary will 'follow' the character on the same position

Movement order

- Character moves first.
- If character moves into boulder, then the boulder will move, then character, then merc, then spider, then zombie toast
